## Series

Contains three functions, fibonacci, lucas, and sum_series. These functions return the nth number in their respective series when given an index number. Note that sum_series follows the same pattern as fibonacci ([0, 1, 1, 2, 3...])and lucas ([2, 1, 3, 4, 7...]), except the first two numbers in the series can be set with optional parameters. These optional parameters otherwise default to the first two numbers in the fibonacci series.
